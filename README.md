# Rick Segal portfolio

### Live site: https://dont-tell-rick.surge.sh/

A modern, minimalist portfolio I built for a friend who works as a Senior Producer at an advertisting agency. Built with Angular. I also wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/@johnnycopes/lessons-learned-from-my-first-angular-2-project-c3ff2593fe7d) about this project.

#### Goals of this project:

- Build a project using Angular to put what I've learned so far into practice
- Create a sensible project structure
- Make a entirely custom layout built with SCSS

#### Local installation:

To run this locally on your machine, simply clone the repo and enter the following commands into your CLI:

```
`ng serve --open`
```

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
