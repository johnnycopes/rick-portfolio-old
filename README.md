# Rick Segal portfolio page

This is my first completed project in Angular! A modern, minimalistic portfolio for my friend who works as a Senior Producer at an advertisting agency. Entirely custom layout built purely with SCSS (no frameworks).

## To run

Run `ng serve --open` to launch the project. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
